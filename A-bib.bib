  abstract = {This paper formulates optimal pacing of a cyclist on hilly terrain time-trials as a minimum-time optimal control problem. Maximal power of a cyclist serves as a time-varying constraint and depends on fatigue and recovery which are captured via dynamic models proposed early in the paper. Experimental protocols for identifying the individualized parameters of the proposed fatigue and recovery models are detailed and results for six human subjects are shown. In an analytical treatment via necessary conditions of Pontryagin Minimum Principle, we show that the cyclist's optimal power in a time-trial is limited to only four modes of all-out, coasting, pedaling at a critical power, or constant speed (bang-singular-bang). To determine when to switch between these modes, we resort to numerical solution via dynamic programming. One of the subjects is then simulated on four courses including the 2019 Duathlon National Championship in Greenville, SC. The dynamic programming simulation results show 24\% reduction in travel time over experimental results of the self-paced subject who is a competitive amateur cyclist. The paper concludes with description of a pilot lab experiment in which the subject trial time was reduced by 3\% when the near-optimal pace was communicated to her in real-time.},

  abstract = {Lactate or gas exchange threshold (GET) and critical power (CP) are closely associated with human exercise performance. We tested the hypothesis that the limit of tolerance (Tlim) during cycle exercise performed within the exercise intensity domains demarcated by GET and CP is linked to discrete muscle metabolic and neuromuscular responses. Eleven men performed a ramp incremental exercise test, 4\textendash 5 severe-intensity (SEV; {$>$}CP) constant-work-rate (CWR) tests until Tlim, a heavy-intensity (HVY; {$<$}CP but {$>$}GET) CWR test until Tlim, and a moderate-intensity (MOD; {$<$}GET) CWR test until Tlim. Muscle biopsies revealed that a similar (P {$>$} 0.05) muscle metabolic milieu (i.e., low pH and [PCr] and high [lactate]) was attained at Tlim (approximately 2\textendash 14 min) for all SEV exercise bouts. The muscle metabolic perturbation was greater at Tlim following SEV compared with HVY, and also following SEV and HVY compared with MOD (all P {$<$} 0.05). The normalized M-wave amplitude for the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle decreased to a similar extent following SEV (-38 {$\pm$} 15\%), HVY (-68 {$\pm$} 24\%), and MOD (-53 {$\pm$} 29\%), (P {$>$} 0.05). Neural drive to the VL increased during SEV (4 {$\pm$} 4\%; P {$<$} 0.05) but did not change during HVY or MOD (P {$>$} 0.05). During SEV and HVY, but not MOD, the rates of change in M-wave amplitude and neural drive were correlated with changes in muscle metabolic ([PCr], [lactate]) and blood ionic/acid-base status ([lactate], [K+]) (P {$<$} 0.05). The results of this study indicate that the metabolic and neuromuscular determinants of fatigue development differ according to the intensity domain in which the exercise is performed. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The gas exchange threshold and the critical power demarcate discrete exercise intensity domains. For the first time, we show that the limit of tolerance during whole-body exercise within these domains is characterized by distinct metabolic and neuromuscular responses. Fatigue development during exercise greater than critical power is associated with the attainment of consistent ``limiting'' values of muscle metabolites, whereas substrate availability and limitations to muscle activation may constrain performance at lower intensities.},

  abstract = {The duration that exercise can be maintained decreases as the power requirements increase. In this review, we describe the power-duration (PD) relationship across the full range of attainable power outputs in humans. We show that a remarkably small range of power outputs is sustainable (power outputs below the critical power, CP). We also show that the origin of neuromuscular fatigue differs considerably depending on the exercise intensity domain in which exercise is performed. In the moderate domain (below the lactate threshold, LT), fatigue develops slowly and is predominantly of central origin (residing in the central nervous system). In the heavy domain (above LT but below CP), both central and peripheral (muscle) fatigue are observed. In this domain, fatigue is frequently correlated with the depletion of muscle glycogen. Severe-intensity exercise (above the CP) is associated with progressive derangements of muscle metabolic homeostasis and consequent peripheral fatigue. To counter these effects, muscle activity increases progressively, as does pulmonary oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), with task failure being associated with the attainment of [Formula: see text] max. Although the loss of homeostasis and thus fatigue develop more rapidly the higher the power output is above CP, the metabolic disturbance and the degree of peripheral fatigue reach similar values at task failure. We provide evidence that the failure to continue severe-intensity exercise is a physiological phenomenon involving multiple interacting mechanisms which indicate a mismatch between neuromuscular power demand and instantaneous power supply. Valid integrative models of fatigue must account for the PD relationship and its physiological basis.},

The system is constructed using Matlab toolboxes (SimMechanics/Simulink) with the aim of identifying mechanical mechanisms that can influence performance in a road cycling time trial. Initial conditions are specified and a variable step ODE solver numerically integrates solutions to the equations of motion. Initial validation compared rider-less self-stability presented in a published ``benchmark'' with model simulation and found an error of {$<$}1.5\%. Model results included the weave eigenvalue becoming negative at 4.2 m/s and the capsize eigenvalue approaching a positive value at 6.1 m/s. The tyre model predicted peak front tyre slip and camber forces of 130 N and 17 N respectively which were within 0.9\% of values reported in the literature. Experimental field validation compared actual and model predicted time taken by 14 experienced cyclists to complete a time trial over an undulating 2.5 mile road course. An error level of 1.4\% ({$\pm$}1.5\%) was found between actual and predicted time. This compares well with the average 1.32\% error reported by existing road cycling models over simpler courses.},

W{${'}$} reconstitution was measured following the first and second recovery periods against which mono-exponential and biexponential models were compared with adjusted R2 and bias-corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). Results\hspace{0.6em} A bi-exponential model outperformed the mono-exponential model of W{${'}$} reconstitution (AICc 30.2 versus 72.2), fitting group mean data well (adjR2\,=\,0.999) for the first recovery when optimised with parameters of fast component (FC) amplitude\,=\,50.67\%; slow component (SC) amplitude\,=\,49.33\%; time constant ({$\tau$})FC\,=\,21.5 s; {$\tau$}SC\,=\,388 s. Following the second recovery, W{${'}$} reconstitution reduced by 9.1\,{$\pm$}\,7.3\%, at 180 s and 8.2\,{$\pm$}\,9.8\% at 240 s resulting in an increase in the modelled {$\tau$}SC to 716 s with {$\tau$}FC unchanged. Individual bi-exponential models also fit well (adjR2\,=\,0.978\,{$\pm$}\,0.017) with large individual parameter variations (FC amplitude 47.7\,{$\pm$}\,17.8\%; first recovery: ({$\tau$})FC\,=\,22.0\,{$\pm$}\,11.8 s; ({$\tau$})SC\,=\,377\,{$\pm$}\,100 s; second recovery: ({$\tau$})FC\,=\,16.3.0\,{$\pm$}\,6.6 s; ({$\tau$})SC\,=\,549\,{$\pm$}\,226 s).

  abstract = {The relationship between the pedaling power and the speed with road cycling can be described in the form of a dynamical system, that accounts for the inertia and several kinds of mechanical friction. Six out of twelve involved constant parameters are known or can be measured, whereas the determination of the remaining six parameters is prohibitive and depends on the specific cyclist, the bicycle, and the road surface. The sought six parameters occur in the model in only four terms with distinct dependency on power and speed. The parameters are combined to yield one coefficient per term. Using real power and speed measurements on a calibration track and a least squares fitting technique, we estimate these four coefficients. Although the interpretation of the distinct physical phenomena cannot be preserved completely, an experimental evaluation shows that our calibration improves the model speed estimation on both the calibration track and on other tracks with the same type of road surface. Moreover, we compare the significance of the parameters and show that, given precise measurements of a moderately varying slope, the calibration is accurate.},

Equipments and methods. \textemdash{} Eleven male cyclists completed an incremental test, three constant work rate tests to exhaustion to determine critical power (CP), and finally two tests until exhaustion at CP and CP plus 5\%. Results. \textemdash{} The modeling of the power-inverse time relationship provided a mean critical power of 295 {$\pm$} 39 W. Time to exhaustion at critical power was significantly higher than 5\% above (22.9 {$\pm$} 7.5 min versus 13.3 {$\pm$} 5.8 min). Oxygen uptake, pulmonary ventilation, and blood lactate obtained at the end of the CP plus 5\% exhaustion trial were not significantly different from the maximal variables. However, the physiological end values during the CP test were significantly lower compared to the incremental test. Conclusions. \textemdash{} These data support the idea that CP in trained cyclists is the physiological index that estimates the boundary between heavy to severe exercise domains. Thus, when cyclists exercised at a power output 5\% higher than CP, the VO2max was reached at the end of exercise. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Neuromuscular functions were assessed before and 50 min after supplementation and 1 min after TT. Oral supplementation alone had no effect on neuromuscular function (P {$>$} 0.05). Compared with placebo, caffeine increased mean power output (\textasciitilde 4\%, P = 0.01) and muscle recruitment (as inferred by EMG, \textasciitilde 17\%, P = 0.01) and reduced the time to complete the TT (\textasciitilde 2\%, P = 0.01). Work performed above CP during the caffeine trial (16.7\,{$\pm$}\,2.1 kJ) was significantly higher than during the placebo (14.7\,{$\pm$}\,2.1 kJ, P = 0.01). End-exercise decline in quadriceps twitch force (pre- to postexercise decrease in twitch force at 1 and 10 Hz) was more pronounced after caffeine compared with placebo (121\,{$\pm$}\,13 and 137\,{$\pm$}\,14 N vs. 146\,{$\pm$}\,13 and 156\,{$\pm$}\,11 N; P {$<$} 0.05). There was no effect of caffeine on central fatigue. In conclusion, caffeine increases muscle recruitment, which enables greater work performed above CP and higher end-exercise peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The link between total work done above critical power and peripheral fatigue during a self-paced, high-intensity exercise is unclear. This study revealed that caffeine ingestion increases muscle recruitment, which enables greater work done above critical power and a greater degree of end-exercise decline in quadriceps twitch force during a 4-km cycling time trial. These findings suggest that caffeine increases performance at the expense of greater locomotor muscle fatigue.},

  abstract = {A simple mathematical model is used to find the optimal distribution of a cyclist's effort during a time trial. It is shown that maintaining a constant velocity is optimal if the goal is to minimise the time taken to complete the course while fixing amount of work done. However, this is usually impractical on a non-flat course because the cyclist would be unable to maintain the power output required on the climbs. A model for exertion is introduced and used to identify the distribution of power that minimises time while restricting the cyclist's exertion. It is shown that, for a course with a climb followed by a descent, limits on exertion prevent the cyclist from improving performance by shifting effort towards the climb and away from the descent. It is also shown, however, that significant improvement is possible on a course with several climbs and descents. An analogous problem with climbs and descents replaced by headwinds and tailwinds is considered and it is shown that there is no significant advantage to be gained by varying power output. Lagrange multipliers are used solve the minimisation problems.},

  abstract = {Introduction/Purpose: Critical power (CP) is a fundamental parameter defining high-intensity exercise tolerance; however, its physiological determinants are incompletely understood. The present study determined the impact of hyperoxia on CP, the time constant of phase II pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics ([tau]V[spacing dot above]O2), and muscle oxygenation (assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy) in nine healthy men performing upright cycle ergometry., Methods: Critical power was determined in normoxia and hyperoxia (fraction of inspired O2 = 0.5) via four severe-intensity constant load exercise tests to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer, repeated once in each condition. During each test, [tau]V[spacing dot above]O2 and the time constant of muscle deoxyhemoglobin kinetics ([tau][HHb]), alongside absolute concentrations of muscle oxyhemoglobin ([HbO2]), were determined., Results: Critical power was greater (hyperoxia, 216 +/- 30 W vs normoxia, 197 +/- 29 W; P {$<$} 0.001), whereas W' was reduced (hyperoxia, 15.4 +/- 5.2 kJ; normoxia, 17.5 +/- 4.3 W; P = 0.037) in hyperoxia compared with normoxia. [tau]V[spacing dot above]O2 (hyperoxia, 35 +/- 12 s vs normoxia, 33 +/- 10 s; P = 0.33) and [tau][HHb] (hyperoxia, 11 +/- 5 s vs normoxia, 14 +/- 5 s; P = 0.65) were unchanged between conditions, whereas [HbO2] during exercise was greater in hyperoxia compared with normoxia (hyperoxia, 73 +/- 20 vs normoxia, 66 +/- 15 [mu]M; P {$<$} 0.001)., Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into the physiological determinants of CP and by extension, exercise tolerance. Microvascular oxygenation and CP were improved during exercise in hyperoxia compared with normoxia. Importantly, the improved microvascular oxygenation afforded by hyperoxia did not alter [tau]V[spacing dot above]O2, suggesting that microvascular O2 availability is an independent determinant of the upper limit for steady-state exercise, that is, CP., (C) 2020 American College of Sports Medicine},

Eighteen male cyclists were assigned to either a pressure-threshold IMT or sham hypoxic-training placebo (PLC) group. Prior to and following a 6~week intervention subjects completed a 25-km cycling time-trial and three constant-power tests to establish the Wlim\textendash Tlim relationship. Constant-power tests were prescribed to elicit exercise intolerance within 3\textendash 10 (Ex1), 10\textendash 20 (Ex2), and 20\textendash 30 (Ex3) min. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure increased by (mean~{$\pm~$}SD) 17.1~{$\pm~$}12.2\% following IMT (P~{$<~$}0.01) and was accompanied by a 2.66~{$\pm~$}2.51\% improvement in 25-km time-trial performance (P~{$<~$}0.05); there were no changes following PLC. Constant-power cycling endurance was unchanged following PLC, as was CP (pre vs. post: 249~{$\pm~$}32 vs. 250~{$\pm~$}32 W) and AWC (30.7~{$\pm~$}12.7 vs. 30.1~{$\pm~$}12.5~kJ). Following IMT Ex1 and Ex3 cycling endurance improved by 18.3~{$\pm~$}15.1 and 15.3~{$\pm~$}19.1\% (P~{$<~$}0.05), respectively, CP was unchanged (264~{$\pm~$}62 vs. 263~{$\pm~$}61~W), but AWC increased from 24.8~{$\pm~$}5.6 to 29.0~{$\pm~$}8.4~kJ (P~{$<~$}0.05). In conclusion, these data provide novel evidence that improvements in constant-power and cycling time-trial performance following IMT in cyclists may be explained, in part, by an increase in AWC.},

  abstract = {For high-intensity muscular exercise, the time-to-exhaustion (t) increases as a predictable and hyperbolic function of decreasing power (P) or velocity (V). This relationship is highly conserved across diverse species and different modes of exercise and is well described by two parameters: the "critical power" (CP or CV), which is the asymptote for power or velocity, and the curvature constant (W') of the relationship such that t = W'/(P - CP). CP represents the highest rate of energy transduction (oxidative ATP production, V[spacing dot above]O2) that can be sustained without continuously drawing on the energy store W' (composed in part of anaerobic energy sources and expressed in kilojoules). The limit of tolerance (time t) occurs when W' is depleted. The CP concept constitutes a practical framework in which to explore mechanisms of fatigue and help resolve crucial questions regarding the plasticity of exercise performance and muscular systems physiology. This brief review presents the practical and theoretical foundations for the CP concept, explores rigorous alternative mathematical approaches, and highlights exciting new evidence regarding its mechanistic bases and its broad applicability to human athletic performance., (C)2010The American College of Sports Medicine},

  abstract = {The curvilinear relationship between power output and the time for which it can be sustained is a fundamental and well-known feature of high-intensity exercise performance. This relationship `levels off' at a `critical power' (CP) that separates power outputs that can be sustained with stable values of, for example, muscle phosphocreatine, blood lactate, and pulmonary oxygen uptake (\$\$ \textbackslash dot\{V\}\{\textbackslash text\{O\}\}\_\{2\} \$\$), from power outputs where these variables change continuously with time until their respective minimum and maximum values are reached and exercise intolerance occurs. The amount of work that can be done during exercise above CP (the so-called W{${'}$}) is constant but may be utilized at different rates depending on the proximity of the exercise power output to CP. Traditionally, this two-parameter CP model has been employed to provide insights into physiological responses, fatigue mechanisms, and performance capacity during continuous constant power output exercise in discrete exercise intensity domains. However, many team sports (e.g., basketball, football, hockey, rugby) involve frequent changes in exercise intensity and, even in endurance sports (e.g., cycling, running), intensity may vary considerably with environmental/course conditions and pacing strategy. In recent years, the appeal of the CP concept has been broadened through its application to intermittent high-intensity exercise. With the assumptions that W{${'}$} is utilized during work intervals above CP and reconstituted during recovery intervals below CP, it can be shown that performance during intermittent exercise is related to four factors: the intensity and duration of the work intervals and the intensity and duration of the recovery intervals. However, while the utilization of W{${'}$} may be assumed to be linear, studies indicate that the reconstitution of W{${'}$} may be curvilinear with kinetics that are highly variable between individuals. This has led to the development of a new CP model for intermittent exercise in which the balance of W{${'}$} remaining (\$\$ W\_\{\textbackslash text\{BAL\}\}\^\{\textbackslash prime \} \$\$) may be calculated with greater accuracy. Field trials of athletes performing stochastic exercise indicate that this \$\$ W\_\{\textbackslash text\{BAL\}\}\^\{\textbackslash prime \} \$\$model can accurately predict the time at which W{${'}$} tends to zero and exhaustion is imminent. The \$\$ W\_\{\textbackslash text\{BAL\}\}\^\{\textbackslash prime \} \$\$model potentially has important applications in the real-time monitoring of athlete fatigue progression in endurance and team sports, which may inform tactics and influence pacing strategy.},

  abstract = {Body position is known to alter power production and affect cycling performance. The aim of this study was to compare mechanical power output in two riding positions, and to calculate the effects on critical power (CP) and W{${'}$} estimates. Seven trained cyclists completed three peak power output efforts and three fixed-duration trial (3-, 5- and 12-min) riding with their hands on the brake lever hoods (BLH), or in a time trial position (TTP). A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that mean power output during the 5-min trial was significantly different between BLH and TTP positions, resulting in a significantly lower estimate of CP, but not W{${'}$}, for the TTP trial. In addition, TTP decreased the performance during each trial and increased the percentage difference between BLH and TTP with greater trial duration. There were no differences in pedal cadence or heart rate during the 3-min trial; however, TTP results for the 12-min trial showed a significant fall in pedal cadence and a significant rise in heart rate. The findings suggest that cycling position affects power output and influences consequent CP values. Therefore, cyclists and coaches should consider the cycling position used when calculating CP.

  abstract = {Emerging trends in technological innovations, data analysis and practical applications have facilitated the measurement of cycling power output in the field, leading to improvements in training prescription, performance testing and race analysis. This review aimed to critically reflect on power profiling strategies in association with the power-duration relationship in cycling, to provide an updated view for applied researchers and practitioners. The authors elaborate on measuring power output followed by an outline of the methodological approaches to power profiling. Moreover, the deriving a power-duration relationship section presents existing concepts of power-duration models alongside exercise intensity domains. Combining laboratory and field testing discusses how traditional laboratory and field testing can be combined to inform and individualize the power profiling approach. Deriving the parameters of power-duration modelling suggests how these measures can be obtained from laboratory and field testing, including criteria for ensuring a high ecological validity (e.g. rider specialization, race demands). It is recommended that field testing should always be conducted in accordance with pre-established guidelines from the existing literature (e.g. set number of prediction trials, inter-trial recovery, road gradient and data analysis). It is also recommended to avoid single effort prediction trials, such as functional threshold power. Power-duration parameter estimates can be derived from the 2 parameter linear or non-linear critical power model: P(t)\,=\,W{${'}$}/t\,+\,CP (W{${'}$}\textemdash work capacity above CP; t\textemdash time). Structured field testing should be included to obtain an accurate fingerprint of a cyclist's power profile.},

The system was then loaded 3 times with 4 different masses while the cyclist pedalled to keep his position. The mean deviation (trueness) to the model and coefficient of variation (precision) were analysed. The mean deviations of the power meters were -0.9{$\pm$}3.2\% (mean{$\pm$}SD) with 6 power meters deviating by more than{$\pm$}5\%. The coefficients of variation of the power meters were 1.2{$\pm$}0.9\% (mean{$\pm$}SD), with Stages varying more than SRM (p{$<$}0.001) and PowerTap (p{$<$}0.001). In conclusion, current power meters used by elite and recreational cyclists vary considerably in their trueness; precision is generally high but differs between manufacturers. Calibrating and adjusting the trueness of every power meter against a first principle-based reference is advised for accurate measurements.},

This unlocks the access to advanced metrics that can guide athletes in many different situations, ranging from high intensity intervals to long steady rides. In the following, I will provide a brief summary of the implementation and testing of a human performance model for bike riding. The approach consists in blending two different models already available in the scientific literature, each specific for a particular target; namely, the Critical Power Model and Record Power Profile. Most of the work consisted in writing the code in the Monkey C language for the Garmin F\=enixTM 3 device and testing the implementation against Golden Cheetah, the software that I consider the gold standard as far as bike performance science is concerned. This implementation also works for other Garmin devices compatible with the Connect IQ platform, like e.g. the Forerunner 920XT, that can read, via ANT+, the output of a power meter installed on the bike. The purpose of this memo is not to promote this specific model as superior to other approaches, but to illustrate what, to my knowledge, is the first implementation of human performance modelling on bike computers. Other more sophisticated models could be implemented as well.},

A bicycle-mounted power measurement system was validated by comparison with a laboratory ergometer. Power was measured during road cycling, and the measured values were compared with the values predicted by the model. The measured values for power were highly correlated (R2 = .97) with, and were not different than, the modeled values. The standard error between the modeled and measured power (2.7 W) was very small. The model was also used to estimate the effects of changes in several model parameters on cycling velocity. Over the range of parameter values evaluated, velocity varied linearly (R2 {$>$} .99). The results demonstrated that cycling power can be accurately predicted by a mathematical model.},

Model theoretic development reveals that total endurance time is always a step function of one or more of the four independent variables: work interval power output (Pw), rest interval power output (Pr), work interval duration (tw), and rest interval duration (tr). Six endurance-trained male athletes recorded their best performances during the season in 3-, 5-, and 10-km races, and performed three different intermittent running tests to exhaustion in random order, recording their total endurance times. These data were used to illustrate the model and compare anaerobic distance capacities ({$\alpha$}) and critical velocities ({$\beta$}) estimated from each type of exercise. Good fits of the model to data were obtained in all cases: 0.954},

  abstract = {The hyperbolic form of the power-duration relationship is rigorous and highly conserved across species, forms of exercise and individual muscles/muscle groups. For modalities such as cycling, the relationship resolves to two parameters, the asymptote for power (critical power, CP) and the so-called W{${'}$} (work doable above CP), which together predict the tolerable duration of exercise above CP. Crucially, the CP concept integrates sentinel physiological profiles - respiratory, metabolic and contractile - within a coherent framework that has great scientific and practical utility. Rather than calibrating equivalent exercise intensities relative to metabolically distant parameters such as the lactate threshold or \.VO2 max, setting the exercise intensity relative to CP unifies the profile of systemic and intramuscular responses and, if greater than CP, predicts the tolerable duration of exercise until W{${'}$} is expended, \.VO2 max is attained, and intolerance is manifested. CP may be regarded as a `fatigue threshold' in the sense that it separates exercise intensity domains within which the physiological responses to exercise can ({$<$}CP) or cannot ({$>$}CP) be stabilized. The CP concept therefore enables important insights into 1) the principal loci of fatigue development (central vs. peripheral) at different intensities of exercise, and 2) mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic control and their modulation by factors such as O2 delivery. Practically, the CP concept has great potential application in optimizing athletic training programs and performance as well as improving the life quality for individuals enduring chronic disease.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The critical power (CP) model includes two constants: the CP and the W' [P = (W' / t) + CP]. The W' is the finite work capacity available above CP. Power output above CP results in depletion of the W' complete depletion of the W' results in exhaustion. Monitoring the W' may be valuable to athletes during training and competition. Our purpose was to develop a function describing the dynamic state of the W' during intermittent exercise., Methods: After determination of V[spacing dot above]O2max, CP, and W', seven subjects completed four separate exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on different days. Each protocol comprised a set of intervals: 60 s at a severe power output, followed by 30-s recovery at a lower prescribed power output. The intervals were repeated until exhaustion. These data were entered into a continuous equation predicting balance of W' remaining, assuming exponential reconstitution of the W'. The time constant was varied by an iterative process until the remaining modeled W' = 0 at the point of exhaustion., Results: The time constants of W' recharge were negatively correlated with the difference between sub-CP recovery power and CP. The relationship was best fit by an exponential (r2 = 0.77). The model-predicted W' balance correlated with the temporal course of the rise in V[spacing dot above]O2 (r2 = 0.82-0.96). The model accurately predicted exhaustion of the W' in a competitive cyclist during a road race., Conclusions: We have developed a function to track the dynamic state of the W' during intermittent exercise. This may have important implications for the planning and real-time monitoring of athletic performance., (C)2012The American College of Sports Medicine},

  abstract = {The ability to predict the systematic decrease of power during physical exertion gives valuable insights into health, performance, and injury. This review surveys the research of power-based models of fatigue and recovery within the area of human performance. Upon a thorough review of available literature, it is observed that the two-parameter critical power model is most popular due to its simplicity. This two-parameter model is a hyperbolic relationship between power and time with critical power as the power-asymptote and the curvature constant denoted by W{${'}$}. Critical power (CP) is a theoretical power output that can be sustained indefinitely by an individual, and the curvature constant (W{${'}$}) represents the amount of work that can be done above CP. Different methods and models have been validated to determine CP and W{${'}$}, most of which are algebraic manipulations of the two-parameter model. The models yield different CP and W{${'}$} estimates for the same data depending on the regression fit and rounding off approximations. These estimates, at the subject level, have an inherent day-to-day variability called intra-individual variability (IIV) associated with them, which is not captured by any of the existing methods. This calls for a need for new methods to arrive at the IIV associated with CP and W{${'}$}. Furthermore, existing models focus on the expenditure of W{${'}$} for efforts above CP and do not model its recovery in the sub-CP domain. Thus, there is a need for methods and models that account for (i) the IIV to measure the effectiveness of individual training prescriptions and (ii) the recovery of W{${'}$} to aid human performance optimization.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to present the load, intensity, and performance characteristics of a general classification (GC) contender during multiple grand tours (GTs). This study also investigated which factors influence climbing performance. METHODS: Power output (PO) data were collected from a GC contender from the Vuelta a Espa\~na 2015, the Giro d'Italia 2017, the Giro d'Italia 2018, and the Tour de France 2018. Load (e.g., Training Stress Score and kJ spent) and intensity in five PO zones were quantified. One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences between the GTs. Furthermore, performance during the four GTs was quantified based on maximal mean PO (W{$\cdot$}kg) over different durations and by the relative PO (W{$\cdot$}kg) on the key mountains in the GTs. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify which factors influence relative PO on the key mountains. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between load and intensity characteristics between the four GTs, with the exception that during the Giro d'Italia 2018, a significantly lower absolute time was spent in PO zone 5 (P = 0.005) compared with the other three GTs. The average relative PO on the key mountains (n = 33) was 5.9 {$\pm$} 0.6 W{$\cdot$}kg and was negatively influenced by the duration of the climb and the total elevation gain before the key mountain, whereas the gradient of the mountain had a positive effect on relative PO. CONCLUSIONS: The physiological load imposed on a GC contender did not differ between multiple GTs. Climbing performance was influenced by short-term fatigue induced by previous altitude meters in the stage and the duration and gradient of the mountain.},

  abstract = {It has previously been shown that cyclists are unable to maintain a constant power output during cycle time-trials on hilly courses. The purpose of the present study is therefore to quantify these effects of power variation using a mathematical model of cycling performance. A hypothetical cyclist (body mass: 70\hspace{0.25em}kg, bicycle mass: 10\hspace{0.25em}kg) was studied using a mathematical model of cycling, which included the effects of acceleration. Performance was modelled over three hypothetical 40-km courses, comprising repeated 2.5-km sections of uphill and downhill with gradients of 1\%, 3\%, and 6\%, respectively. Amplitude (5-15\%) and distance (0.31-20.00\hspace{0.25em}km) of variation were modelled over a range of mean power outputs (200-600\hspace{0.25em}W) and compared to sustaining a constant power. Power variation was typically detrimental to performance; these effects were augmented as the amplitude of variation and severity of gradient increased. Varying power every 1.25\hspace{0.25em}km was most detrimental to performance; at a mean power of 200\hspace{0.25em}W, performance was impaired by 43.90\hspace{0.25em}s ({$\pm$}15\% variation, 6\% gradient). However at the steepest gradients, the effect of power variation was relatively independent of the distance of variation. In contrast, varying power in parallel with changes in gradient improved performance by 188.89\hspace{0.25em}s ({$\pm$}15\% variation, 6\% gradient) at 200\hspace{0.25em}W. The present data demonstrate that during hilly time-trials, power variation that does not occur in parallel with changes in gradient is detrimental to performance, especially at steeper gradients. These adverse effects are substantially larger than those previously observed during flat, windless time-trials.},
