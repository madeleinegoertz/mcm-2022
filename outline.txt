Introduction
	Restatement of the Problem
	Some background on time trialing
	Power Curves
		Leo et al review article, issues with power curves	
	Existing models of power output over time
		Sreedhara et al review article
		3-tank model
			Bad because no real flow information
		Skiba model
	Our assumptions
		Rider/biker
		Environmental
		Classify which ones we deemed critical
Our Models	
	Power Curves
		Andrew Coggan's data curves
		Goldencheetah OSF curves
		Our final time trialist one?
		Our final endurance rider one?
		How we get the desired P_C value from the curve
			Calculating total estimated time of the race. 
	Race Profiles
		Model 0: Constant Power of P=P_c, 
			Assumptions
				- Flat terrain, no turns, constant power
				- Drag! 
			Derivation
			Graphs - v v. t, p v. t
			Parameter space testing for v_max - surface
		Model 1: Nonconstant Power
			Assumptions
				- Flat terrain, no turns
				- Start varying power
			Derivation
			More graphs/parameter space searching
		Model 2: Elevation Change
			Assumptions
				- Straight course but elevation changes. 
				- Drag, rollin resistance, gravitational resistance 
			Derivation
			Getting angle data from the real courses. 
		Model 3: Curvy road
			Assumptions
				- Additional limiting term controlling max velocity in turns
		Model 4: Nonconstant wind, rain
			Assumptions
				- Drag varies based on headwind/tailwind. 
				- Rain lowers coefficient of static friction (turns) and coefficient of rolling resistance
